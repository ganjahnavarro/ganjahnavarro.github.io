                    Happy 23rd birthday! Cheers to your first birthday with me. Wish ko lang is to stay cheerful with whatever
                    you'll do and whenever you'll go (hopefully with me haha). And a little less overthinking lang siguro. This ain't temporary.
                    <br /> <br />
                    Thanks for believing. Thanks for doing the leap of faith alongside me. You're saying that I'm letting
                    you see the world differently, but it's also the other way around. It's hard to express how happy I am
                    with our unplanned getaway last weekend. It's a breathe of fresh air, literally and figuratively.
                    <br /> <br />
                    I know it has been hard (at exciting na rin at the same time) for you this past few weeks, but don't worry
                    matatapos na rin naman yan. All will be well in time. Para sakin it doesn't matter how messy our
                    relationship started, because if I will be given a chance to go back and reconsider my decisions, I'll choose this over and over again.
                    <br /> <br />
                    P.S. Thanks sa pagpa "copy" ng Game of Thrones.
